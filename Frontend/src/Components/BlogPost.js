          The biggest difference between ChatGPT and Bard is the Large Language
          Models (LLMs) they are powered by. ChatGPT uses the Generative
          Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), while Bard uses the Language Model
          for Dialogue Applications (LaMBDA). Also, ChatGPT is developed by
          OpenAI, while Bard was built by Google.
